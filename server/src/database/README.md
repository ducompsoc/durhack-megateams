[Database Guidelines Pulled From Here](https://dev.to/ovid/database-naming-standards-2061)

# Database Rules

- Use underscore_names instead of CamelCase
- Table names should be plural
- Spell out id fields (item_id instead of id)
- Don't use ambiguous column names
- When possible, name foreign key columns the same as the columns they refer to

# User, Team, Megateam relationship

Each user can create or join a team

Each team can enter what area they are working at

Each area is associated with a megateam

User -> Team -> Area -> Megateam

## Entity Relationship Diagram

## Notes on implications

- If a user changes team, their points would change to be added to that team
- If a team changed area, their points would change to be added to that area's megateam
  > After initially selecting a location, the only people that can reassign locations/megateams for a team would be volunteers and admin users (see [#3](https://github.com/ducompsoc/durhack-megateams/issues/3), [#4](https://github.com/ducompsoc/durhack-megateams/issues/4))

- Abuse will be prevented by only allowing volunteers and admins to change team/megateam association
